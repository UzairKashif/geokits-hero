# GIS-Driven Agritech Transformation

Our team at GeoKits recently conducted a large-scale GIS-driven precision agriculture pilot across 40 acres in Punjab, Pakistan.

## The Need for GIS-Driven Agriculture

Pakistan's smallholder farms have long depended on traditional techniquesâ€”reading cloud formations for rain, visual crop inspections for pests, and fixed calendars for spraying.

### Satellite Imagery Analysis
High-resolution multispectral satellite data was processed to monitor crop health, identify stress patterns, and track growth progression across different field zones.

## Key Findings

### Weather Alert System Impact
Early notification of rain, frost, and heat waves led to **30% fewer instances** of water stress and **25% savings** on irrigation costs.

### Yield Improvement Results
Through variable-rate fertilizer application and precision irrigation, average crop yields rose by **20%** compared with neighboring farms using conventional methods.
